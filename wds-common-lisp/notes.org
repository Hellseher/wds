** Q-200112222429: How to load ASDF ready system to your fresh image?
*** Solution
The easyest way is to perform that task via Quicklisp package
manager and Emacs's SLIME package.

*** Pre-requirements:
+ You have Emacs semi configured and running.
+ You have SLIME package installed.
+ You have one of the implementations of CL compiler installed and
  running (SBCL).
+ Quicklisp is installed and configured with your compiler to load
  automatically.

*** Actions
+ <emacs> ~M-x slime~ ; Starting SLIME connection to the CL image
+ <CL-USER> (load (from-home-path "path/to/your/file.asd"))
+ <CL-USER> (ql:quickload :name-of-your-system)

*** Result
If your system is defined correctly Quicklisp starts to load all
dependencies specified in the system to the current image.
