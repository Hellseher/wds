* Intro
Main modules of Python useful for system programming

** Buildin Modules[fn:1]
- os ::	Miscellaneous operating system interfaces.
- os.path :: Operations on pathnames.
- subprocess ::  allows you to spawn new processes, connect to their
                 input/output/error pipes, and obtain their return
                 codes.
- sys :: Access system-specific parameters and functions.

** Extenal Modules
- [[http://www.fabfile.org/][Fabric]] :: library and command-line tool for streamlining the use of
            SSH for application deployment or systems administration
            tasks.
- [[http://www.paramiko.org/][Paramiko]]  :: implementation of the SSHv2 protocol, providing
               both client and server functionality.
- [[https://pexpect.readthedocs.io/en/stable/][Pexpect]] :: is a pure Python module for spawning child applications;
             controlling them; and responding to expected patterns in
             their output. Pexpect works like Don Libes’ Expect.

** General templaes
/General template of script file/
#+BEGIN_SRC python
  #!/usr/bin/env python
  # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

  # Default templates for Python scripts.

  def main():
      print("Hello World!")

  if __name__ == '__main__':
      main()
#+END_SRC

Your scrip has to awere of what version is on the system and minimal
or exact required version. Better run it before all main modules will
be loaded.

/Inscript version check to avaid future conflicts/
#+BEGIN_SRC python
  #!/usr/bin/env python
  # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

  # Version check of Python.

  import sys

  PYMIN = 0x02060000

  if sys.hexversion < PYMIN:
      sys.exit("Python 2.6 or newer is required to run this script.")

  if sys.hexversion != PYMIN:
      sys.exit("Python 2.6 required to run this script.")

  # body of the script
  # ...
  # end of the script

#+END_SRC
